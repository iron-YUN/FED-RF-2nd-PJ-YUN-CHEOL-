            with years ago.
            * 
            He’s found a new home with Bonnie and her toys, and he’ll do
            anything to make sure she’s happy and they’re all taken care of.
            * But an unexpected reunion with his dear friend Bo Peep shows

            when his efforts land him in a carnival game booth as an inadvertent
            prize, he turns to his inner voice for guidance.`,

            spork-turned-craft-project, Forky is pretty sure that he doesn’t
            belong in Bonnie’s room. * Unfortunately, every time he tries to

            her sheep on a lamp base at Andy’s house.
            * After being separated for years, Bo has become chipped and
            discarded, but her spirit is far from broken. * She has grown
            into an adventure-seeking free spirit whose strength and sarcasm
            belie her delicate porcelain exterior. * When she and Woody are
            reunited under unlikely circumstances, Bo realizes just how much
            she’s missed him, and can’t wait to show him what she’s been up to.`,

            her pull-string voice box has left her sounding anything but
            adorable. * She has spent more than 60 years forgotten in the
            depths of a jam-packed antique store—her only companions are a band
            of voiceless ventriloquist dummies. * Gabby Gabby knows someone
            will want her if only she can find a working voice box to repair
            hers.`,

            prepared to show off his stunt poses with confidence and swagger.
            * However, Woody learns quickly that Duke has an Achilles heel:
            He has never been able to do the awesome stunts advertised in his
            own toy commercial. * For years, Duke has been sitting in an
            antique store, constantly reliving the failures of his tragic past.`,
